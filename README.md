# Always Meet On Time

## Overview

"Always Meet On Time" is a browser extension designed to help you never miss or be late for your Google Meet meetings. You can set a specific time and provide a meeting link, and the extension will automatically open the Google Meet session for you. It also attempts to mute your microphone and turn off your camera by default upon joining, ensuring a smoother entry into your meetings.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Meeting Join:** Schedules and automatically opens Google Meet links at the specified time.
- **Default Mute & Camera Off:** Attempts to mute the microphone and turn off the camera before joining the meeting.
- **Simple Interface:** A clean popup allows users to easily input the meeting time and link.
- **Active Timer Indication:** Input fields are disabled and details are saved when a timer is active, providing clear visual feedback.
- **Tab Closure Warning:** Alerts users with a confirmation dialog if they attempt to close a tab while a meeting timer is active.
- **Persistent Scheduling:** Meeting details are stored locally using `localStorage`, so the schedule persists even if the browser is closed and reopened (until manually stopped).
- **Manual Stop:** Users can cancel the scheduled meeting join at any time via the popup.
